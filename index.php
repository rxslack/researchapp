        <h3>Participant Information</h3>
        <p>This can be viewed and saved from <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NDr1EFejfaWnPDaBrNxRIWSTKhwQIw4BsWdz0IHKAyI/edit?usp=sharing'>here</a></p>
        <p>This is a research project designed to find out how a time limit will affect how a human participant's ability to detect deepfake material will be changed.</p>
        <p>This has been presented to yourself due to being of working age, between 18-65 years of age, due to the likelihood that a person may need to check videos or images one day as part of a job.</p>
        <p>It is up to you to decide if you want to take part. A copy of the information provided here is yours to keep, and you can still decide to withdraw at any time without giving a reason, or you can decide not to answer a particular question by letting the timer run out.</p>
        <p>You will be partaking in an online quiz, with different sections depending on the time limit that is appropriate. You will need to select the image that you perceive to be the deepfake.</p>
        <p>This is a one-off quiz, which does not require your participation again, the quiz itself should not take any longer than 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>All information is going to be held within the university systems, and identifying information, such as name, date of birth, address, etc, will not be gathered as part of the survey.</p>
